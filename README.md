<h1>Hi, I'm Mikey-Debug! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm a software developer who is passionate about coding and constantly learning new technologies. My main focus at the moment is on Python and JavaScript, but I also have experience with PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, C++ (Basic), and Tailwind.

<h2>What I'm Working On,</h2>
Currently, I'm working on building my skills in Python and JavaScript by working on a few personal projects. I want to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub, as I believe it's a great way to improve my coding skills and give back to the community. So if there any please Reach me

<h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
As mentioned earlier, I'm currently focused on learning Python and JavaScript. I'm also looking to improve my skills in web development by learning more about React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
